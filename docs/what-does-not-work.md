# What does not work

Known defects that are still open. Limits that follow from the design are in
[design.md](design.md) under the section of the feature they belong to. Each
entry says what happens,
what to do about it, and where the evidence is.

## Cleanups after a move are not rediscovered after a restart

**What happens.** The deletion of a moved cell's old objects waits for a
grace period in the compactor's memory. If that node restarts first, the
old objects stay until someone runs the cleanup, and moving the cell back
there answers `{:error, :destination_not_cleaned}` until it runs.

**Workaround.** `mix alambique.cleanup CELL LOCATION_ID --instance NAME --connect NODE`
or `Alambique.cleanup_moved/4`.

**Evidence.** [design.md §18](design.md#18-placement).
